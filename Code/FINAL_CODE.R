# Analysis of Baccala Mantecato and Baccala alla Vicentina

## Package Loading and General Configuration

```{r LIBRARIES, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
```

```{r SETWD, warning=FALSE}
base_path <- "D:/Projects_GitHub/BEFD_Project/Data" # Set base path
```

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

```{r DATA LOAD, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- read_csv(file.path(base_path, "data.csv"))
data$Date <- as.Date(data$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d") # ensure date format
data <- data %>% mutate(Month = format(Date, "%m"),
                        Year = as.factor(format(Date, "%Y"))) # create useful features for the models
data$trend <- 1:nrow(data)

head(data,3)
```

Check for missing values
```{r NAN CHECK}
cat("NA counts in dataset:\n")
cat(paste(names(data), colSums(is.na(data)), sep=": "), sep="\n")
```

Then we load a dataset found on [EUMOFA](https://eumofa.eu/web/guest/bulk-download).
We also tried incorporating different variables, such as the NIC for fish products (Istat), the production price of fish products (Istat), and others. However, these variables did not prove to be significantly relevant for our analysis.
Additionally, some other variables we tried do not have monthly data that match the frequency of the sales data we are working with, limiting their usefulness in the context of our time series analysis.

Here we focus on the salmon consumption only because we have seen that other fishes or their aggregate value lead worst results.
```{r}
fish_cons <- read_excel(file.path(base_path, "Fish_consumption_ita_raw.xlsx")) %>%
  filter(CG == "Salmon") %>%
  mutate(kg = as.numeric(`volume(Kg)`)) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(kg = sum(kg), .groups = "drop") %>%
  filter(year > 2020 | (year == 2020 & month %in% c(11, 12))) %>%
  mutate(
    kg_std = scale(kg),
    Date = as.Date(paste(year, month, "01", sep = "-"))
  )  %>%
  select(Date, kg, kg_std)

head(fish_cons, 3)
```

The dataset contains three columns:

Date: Unlike the data related to baccalà, the time series for salmon starts from November 2020. This is because we lack information for the last two months of 2024, so we applied a two-month lag. This choice also makes sense for future applications, as it would not be possible to forecast baccalà sales (whether mantecato or alla vicentina) for December when monthly consumption data for that month is already available.

kg_std: Represents the standardized version of the kg column. Since the values in kg are quite large, we opted to standardize them to simplify further analysis.

kg: Represents the quantity of salmon sold in Italy, measured in kilograms.

Finally we aggregate the salmon monthly consumption time series to our data.
```{r}
data$fish_cons <- fish_cons$kg_std
head(data,3)
```

## Explanatory Analysis

First, we visualize the time series of Baccala Mantecato and Baccala Vicentina over time.
This plot helps us compare the trend of sales for both products on a monthly basis.

```{r PLOT BACCALA fig.width=10}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Baccala_Mantecato, color = "Baccala Mantecato"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Baccala_Vicentina, color = "Baccala Vicentina"), size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Monthly Time Series of Baccala Mantecato and Baccala Vicentina",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Quantity") +
  theme_minimal()
```
The sales quantities of Baccala Mantecato and Baccala Vicentina show significant differences, with Baccala Mantecato consistently having a much higher volume of sales throughout all periods observed. Additionally, Baccala Mantecato exhibits a much wider range of values, indicating greater variability in sales. In contrast, Baccala Vicentina appears more stable, with sales peaks typically occurring towards the end of the year. A similar trend is also seen for Baccala Mantecato, which experiences an uptick in sales during the final months of each year.

Next, we plot the time series for both products grouped by year.
The goal is to observe yearly trends and patterns for Baccala Mantecato and Baccala Vicentina separately.

```{r PLOT BACCALA GROUP BY YEAR fig.width=10}
plot1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Month, y = Baccala_Mantecato, color = Year, group = Year)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Baccala Mantecato", 
       title = "Monthly Time Series of Baccala Mantecato by Year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())

plot2 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Month, y = Baccala_Vicentina, color = Year, group = Year)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Baccala Vicentina", 
       title = "Monthly Time Series of Baccala Vicentina by Year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, nrow = 2)
```
Both graphs highlight the pattern mentioned earlier: for each year, there is an increase in sales during the final months of the year, particularly in September and December. 
Additionally, regarding Baccala Mantecato, it appears that during the earlier years of sales for which we have data, the quantity sold was generally higher in the off-peak months (for example, the orange line for 2021 is higher compared to the other years). However, in the later years, the quantity sold during the peak months has increased.

Finally, we also examined the properties of the time series by plotting the autocorrelation functions (ACF).

```{r}
ym = ts(data$Baccala_Mantecato, frequency = 12, start = c(2021, 1))
yv = ts(data$Baccala_Vicentina, frequency = 12, start = c(2021, 1))

end(ym) #-->is 2024/12?
end(yv) #-->is 2024/12?

acf(data$Baccala_Mantecato, main = "ACF of Baccala Mantecato", col = "blue", lwd = 2)
acf(data$Baccala_Vicentina, main = "ACF of Baccala Vicentina", col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

We now that autocorrelation occurs when the effect of a avriable is spread over time, in these cases, most of the autocorrelations fall within the confidence bands, indicating that the data does not show significant correlation for most lags. 
However, within the bands, the autocorrelations exhibit a sinusoidal pattern, suggesting the presence of seasonality in the data, where periodic fluctuations occur over time. The peak at lag 12 further supports the idea of a cyclical effect.
We will analyze the residuals of future models to confirm or disprove the presence of this seasonality.
